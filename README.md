# Speen Chroma 2
 A complete rewrite of Speen Chroma for Spin Rhythm XD versions 1.0 and above.

## Color profile notice
 Due to limitations in the amount and usage of color profiles, Chroma uses the `Custom 1` color profile, and therefore overrides all custom colors set on this profile. This notice will disappear once this limitation is bypassed.

## Features
 - Rainbow Notes
   - Select notes affected by the effect
   - Adjustable rainbow speed
 - Separate color profile for Chroma effects
 - Config support with BepInEx
